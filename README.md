# Backend Lead Scorer (Scaffold)

This is a scaffolded Node.js + TypeScript + Express project for the Backend Engineer Hiring Assignment.

## What is included
- Project scaffold with TypeScript + Express
- Placeholder controllers and services
- `.env.example`
- `package.json` with dependencies listed (you need to run `npm install` to fetch them)

## Quick start
1. Unzip the project.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run in dev mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Server will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

## Endpoints (placeholders)
- `POST /offer` - save current offer (placeholder)
- `POST /leads/upload` - upload CSV of leads (placeholder)
- `POST /score` - run scoring (placeholder)
- `GET /results` - get scored results (placeholder)

## Notes
- This ZIP contains the scaffold. The actual scoring logic, AI integration, and full controllers are intentionally left as placeholders per your instruction "file me code apn baad me dalenge".
- If you want, I can now proceed to populate each file with full working implementations.
